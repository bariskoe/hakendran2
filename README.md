# Hakendran

This is yet another Todo List app which was fully written by me, Baris Kosebas. I have created it to use it in real life
and to practice every part of a fullstack project.  
The app communicates with a Node.js backend which runs on Google Cloud Functions. All data gets saved locally and in the cloud and synchronized 
with Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.
Both, the mobile app and the backend were completely created by myself.
